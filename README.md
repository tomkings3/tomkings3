### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This repository is used to track my progress through my education in the MSBA program at the University of Utah. 
### EDA Notbook assignment.
#### In this assignment I did an EDA for the Home Credit Default Risk project from the Kaggle competition. 
Tasks
Explore the target variable in application_{train|test}.csv. Is the data unbalanced with respect to the target? What would the accuracy be for a simple model consisting in a majority class classifier?
Explore the relationship between target and predictors, looking for potentially strong predictors that could be included later in a model.
The skimr package in R has some great data exploration tools, and the janitor package has utilities that will simplify data cleaning.
Explore the scope of missing data in application_{train|test}.csv and come up with possible solutions. Remove rows?  Remove columns?  Impute?
Be alert to problems in the data.  Do the values make sense? Are there mistaken values that should be cleaned or imputed? (Note that outliers are not necessarily mistakes. Check APM for advice on how to handle outliers for a predictive project.) Are there columns with near-zero or zero variance?
Will the input data need to be transformed in order to be used in a model? You might answer this question differently for different models. (For example, some models might accept factor variables, others might not.) You can put off answering this question for now,  but you should begin thinking about it. Check APM for advice.
Join application_{train|test}.csv with transactional data in, for example, bureau.csv or previous_application.csv. This will require aggregating the transactional data to have the same grain as the application data.
Explore the joined transactional data.  Do some of the added columns show promise in predicting default?

### Home Credit Defalut Risk Analysis
#### In this project I worked with a group in The first phase of the CRISP-DM analytics project lifecycle is business understanding, which includes the tasks of framing the business problem and writing a business problem statement.
Tasks
Practice framing a business problem and an analytic problem.
Practice writing a business problem statement.
