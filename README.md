### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This repository is used to track my progress through my education in the MSBA program at the University of Utah. 
### EDA Notbook assignment.
#### In this assignment I did an EDA for the Home Credit Default Risk project from the Kaggle competition. 
### Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective
In the financial sector, assessing creditworthiness is a critical business challenge, especially for customers with limited credit history. Our project aims to predict the probability of loan defaults using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, which contains both application and transactional data. The objective is to develop a predictive model that helps in making informed lending decisions, thereby reducing risk and supporting financial inclusion.

### Our Group's Solution to the Business Problem
Our solution involves comprehensive data exploration, cleaning, and analysis followed by predictive modeling using machine learning techniques. We focus on understanding the relationship between the target variable and potential predictors, dealing with missing data, and enriching our dataset by joining application data with transactional records. Our approach is data-driven and aims to extract meaningful insights to aid in accurate default prediction.

### My contribution to the project included:
Analyzing the balance of the target variable in the dataset and assessing the impact of data imbalance on model accuracy.
Exploring relationships between the target and predictor variables to identify strong predictors.
Handling missing data in the application datasets, considering strategies like row/column removal and imputation.
Data cleaning and validation to ensure data quality and consistency.
Joining application data with transactional data from other sources like bureau.csv and previous_application.csv.
The Business Value of the Solution
Our predictive model aims to significantly improve decision-making in the loan approval process. By accurately identifying potential defaults, the model can reduce financial risks. It also supports responsible lending by avoiding overburdening customers with loans they might struggle to repay.

### Challenges faced included:
Managing unbalanced data and its impact on model performance.
Dealing with a significant amount of missing data and deciding on the best strategies for handling it.
Ensuring data integrity, especially when joining datasets of different structures and sources.
What You Learned in the Project
This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, particularly in handling missing data and data imbalances. I gained insights into the importance of thorough exploratory data analysis to guide the modeling process and learned advanced techniques for joining and aggregating complex datasets.


### Home Credit Defalut Risk Analysis
#### In this project I worked with a group in The first phase of the CRISP-DM analytics project lifecycle is business understanding, which includes the tasks of framing the business problem and writing a business problem statement.
Tasks
Practice framing a business problem and an analytic problem.
Practice writing a business problem statement.
