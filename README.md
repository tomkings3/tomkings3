### Hi there 👋 This repository is used to track my progress through my education in the MSBA program at the University of Utah. 
### EDA Notbook assignment & Group project on Swire.
In this assignment I did an EDA & predictive analysis for Swire Coca Cola. This was done individually then the predictive analysis was done as a group. 
### Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective
Swire Coca-Cola has encountered a challenge with predicting one of its beverage lines, specifically the brand 'Sparkling Jacceptabletlester'. Despite the expectation that this product would perform well during the key sales months of March and April, the the forcast doesn't look good. The product, characterized by its 'Regular' caloric segment, 'SSD' market category, and avocado flavor, packaged as '11Small MLT', has underachieved in terms of dollar sales.

The core business problem here is to understand why 'Sparkling Jacceptabletlester' is not resonating with consumers as anticipated, and to determine what strategic adjustments can be made to improve its market performance. This may involve reevaluating the product's features, its positioning, marketing approach, or other aspects of the sales and distribution strategy to better align with consumer preferences and increase sales.

### Our Group's Solution to the Business Problem
Our solution involved comprehensive data exploration, cleaning, and analysis followed by predictive modeling using machine learning techniques. We focus on understanding the relationship between the target variable and potential predictors, dealing with missing data, and enriching our dataset by joining application data with transactional records. Our approach is data-driven and aims to extract meaningful insights to aid in accurate default prediction.

### My contribution to the project included:
- Analyzing the balance of the target variable in the dataset and assessing the impact of data imbalance on model accuracy.
- Exploring relationships between the target and predictor variables to identify strong predictors.
- Handling missing data in the application datasets, considering strategies like row/column removal and imputation.
- Data cleaning and validation to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Joining application data with transactional data from other sources like general information with zipcodes. 

### The Business Value of the Solution
Our predictive model aims to significantly improve decision-making in the product line. By accurately identifying potential high sales in products with unique features. 

### Challenges faced included:
- Managing unbalanced data and its impact on model performance.
- Massive data, which we countered with inner-join features.
- Dealing with a significant amount of missing data and deciding on the best strategies for handling it.
- Ensuring data integrity, especially when joining datasets of different structures and sources.
### What You Learned in the Project
This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, particularly in handling large data and data imbalances. I gained insights into the importance of thorough exploratory data analysis to guide the modeling process and learned advanced techniques for joining and aggregating complex datasets.


### Home Credit Defalut Risk Analysis
#### In this project I worked with a group in The first phase of the CRISP-DM analytics project lifecycle is business understanding, which includes the tasks of framing the business problem and writing a business problem statement.
### Business Problem Framing
The challenge for financial institutions like Home Credit is to accurately assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, particularly those with limited or no credit history. The primary business problem is to minimize the risk of loan defaults while extending credit services to a broader customer base. Effective prediction of loan default likelihood can lead to more informed lending decisions, reducing financial risk and promoting inclusive financing.

### Analytic Problem Framing
From an analytics perspective, the problem translates to developing a predictive model that can accurately determine the probability of loan defaults based on various financial and personal data points. This involves analyzing large datasets to identify patterns and key indicators of default risk. The analytic challenge is to handle data complexities such as imbalances, missing values, and integration of disparate data sources.
